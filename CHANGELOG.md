## v2.4.2 — Verified QEAPP, network downloads and theme recovery (2026-09-24)

- Discover signed `.qeapp` files in inbox, Downloads and the microSD root, with
  explicit layout and signing-key mismatch diagnostics; never bypass signatures.
- Preserve clicked browser URLs across link-pool reset and retain retry/history
  for failed requests. Support bounded chunked transfer for pages and downloads.
- Validate `.vqeaf` palette/envelope during catalog scan; leave the currently
  applied palette in place when a candidate fails and route theme downloads to
  manual Apply.
- Expose `corediag` and boot-time checks for SD/WiFi/TLS/signing key.
- Add host verification/doctor tooling. Host gate: 17/17 passing; v2.4.0 gate:
  7/7 passing. Hardware test and real PlatformIO build still pending.

## v2.4.0 — S60-inspired package manager core
- Signed QEAPP/2 higher-version update with staged verification and last-version backup.
- Recovery of interrupted installs/updates; never promote unconfirmed staging.
- Per-app data foundation with fixed slots and strict quotas; explicit user reset.
- App Installer progress on 240x320 and Update/Recover/Reset data controls.
- Fresh host regression for SD rename failure, blocked rollback and data integrity.
- Preserve N16R8 GPIO, `.vqeaf` themes, `.qeapp` format and original icon codec.
- Target PlatformIO compilation and physical board tests have not yet run.

# v2.3.5 — Lossless Flash optimization (system icons)
- 24 assets (12 identifiers × 24/36px): crop transparent margins; flattened RLE with long transparent-run escape; choose 4-bit indices when smaller.
- Sprite+RGB565 palette storage: 8,260 → 6,443 bytes (−22.00%); no change to 16-byte ESP32 asset descriptors or no-heap renderer contract.
- Checked independent old/new C++ framebuffer output and PNG-derived RGB565 output.
- Firmware target and physical device build remain unverified until performed on board/toolchain.

## v2.3.4 — Pixel art illustration icon set (2026-09-24)

- Curated the user-generated contact sheet into 12 transparent 36x36 and
  12 separate 24x24 pixel PNGs; no runtime asset decoder or scaling.
- Replaced legacy token palette RLE with per-icon RGB565 palette + safe,
  bounded 5-bit-index/3-bit horizontal RLE in Flash (8,260 data bytes).
- Existing Home, 3x4 Menu and system-list call sites automatically use the
  new art; .vqeaf handles focus/background and .qeapp signed format stays
  unchanged.
- Updated host screenshot comparison to ignore only the intentionally
  replaced icon rectangles; all new icon pixels have independent equality
  tests against source PNGs.
- Kept v2.3.3 offline and dry-run builders. PlatformIO and board unverified.

## v2.3.3 — N16R8 PlatformIO configuration and reproducible build gates

- Add project-local N16R8 board JSON and explicit Arduino-ESP32 2.0.17 16MB OTA partitions
- Pin PlatformIO 6.10.0 and library versions, set max firmware to real app partition (6.25MiB)
- Add C++11 compile-time board/pin guards and boot-time flash/PSRAM serial diagnostics
- Add offline preflight, compile guard test, 26-unit native host link and exact GUI/icon smoke
- Add optional PlatformIO CI and local one-command build logs with honest PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED states
- Preserve UI assets, physical GPIO, `.vqeaf` and signed QEAPP/2 verifier; see docs/BUILD_REPORT_V233.md

# VQEAF OS v2.3.2 — Typed Home/Menu icon integration (2026-09-24)

- Main Menu now maps all 12 slots directly to the standardized 36×36 RGB565 icon IDs in `UiIconCatalog.h`.
- Home WiFi, Music and Files shortcuts directly share the same 36×36 bitmap identities; system lists retain 24×24 assets.
- Added full-UI host pixel-for-pixel parity tests for every icon location, selected focus changes and `.vqeaf`-compatible custom focus colors.
- Added four native 240×320 C++ host renders. No GPIO, signed `.qeapp`, theme format or app service changes.
- Production PlatformIO toolchain and physical ESP32-S3 LCD tests remain pending.

---

# VQEAF OS v2.3.0 — Reference Home/Menu pixel pass (2026-09-24)

- Default first-install appearance is reference Lime from screenshot; old Preferences keys and selected .vqeaf files remain intact.
- 240×320 Home clock, network, 3 tiles, quick-hint, 3 softkeys use the existing pixel atlas; highlight movement now only repaints two affected Home shortcut rectangles.
- Menu remains 3×4 screenshot order: old/new focus cells only; restore row separator and draw two short selected top-corner glints.
- Unify all stock Home/Menu/shared-list icon rendering through the original 36×36 procedural icon art, plus canonical aliases and missing Doc/Bell/Lock/Quick entries.
- Single text role definitions and bounded UTF-8 NFC Vietnamese glyph raster fallback; UTF-8 safe pixel-width clipping in shared screen and optional Explorer.
- Actual source-host C++ RGB565 framebuffer renders compared with user screenshot native crops; palette color masks match 95.94% Home and 96.69% Menu. Host font differs from live hardware fonts; these figures are not full-image pixel similarity and are not an on-device pass.
- Keep VQEAF Theme Studio 1.0 `.vqeaf` parsing and signed QEAPP/2 `.qeapp` installation + existing WiFi/BLE/Browser/Audio/Recovery and board pin map unchanged.
- Host test `python tools/test_ui_v23.py` PASS (includes previous v2.2 host regressions). PlatformIO/physical ESP32 target: **NOT VERIFIED**.

---

# VQEAF OS Changelog

## v2.2.0 — Screenshot layout & pixel atlas (source release)

- Normal boot: Home dashboard (General) restored. MENU opens physical 3x4 Menu with 12 icons exactly ordered as in user screenshot.
- Retained v2.1 six-tab Retro-inspired view as optional Retro Explorer from Menu > Options, not boot Home replacement.
- Shared C++11 geometry header + 16-screen / 162-target-rectangle generated UI atlas, including a detailed per-screen Markdown and JSON spec.
- Studio `.vqeaf launcher{}` RGB565 overrides reach physical Home/Menu/app chrome and softkeys; signed `.qeapp` service and hardware pins untouched.
- Fixed simulated battery fill: outline-only when no ADC available.
- PASS on host: 25 actual firmware translation units compile/link with mocks, UI atlas, theme parser, T9/input, signed QEAPP tamper, WiFi and board diagnostic. Target PlatformIO + hardware are pending.

## VQEAF OS 2.1.0 — New portrait launcher (source-only, host verified)

- Rebrand splash/About, boot into original six-tab Retro-Go-inspired launcher, with 240x320 linear list, preview and modal, preserve original firmware services.
- Default VQEAF Night; Studio .vqeaf palette and optional launcher token overrides with bounded streaming large-file parser.
- Signed existing QEAPP/2 apps integrated in launcher with existing verifier and payload restrictions unchanged.
- SELECT hold mode toggle and deferred short press with editor-only physical numeric multi-tap.
- Added new host verification and device test guide; PlatformIO and physical board remain unverified.

---

## v2.1.0 — VQEAF OS portrait launcher and .vqeaf integration

- New VQEAF OS brand in user-visible boot, About, BLE, browser UA and Shell.
- Original six-tab 240x320 portrait launcher with list highlight, scrollbar,
  selected application preview, full-screen status, popup and signed QEAPP/2 icon.
- Theme Studio `.vqeaf` palette import with optional firmware-only launcher
  extension and fallback to an embedded dark theme.
- Existing signed QEAPP/2 web/text verifier and all earlier core services retained.
- Retain NVS storage namespace across upgrades; DOWN/A hardware Safe Mode chord.
- No physical build/board claims: see verification report.

## v2.0.1 – On-board verification kit

- Added production-CA TLS diagnostic probes with DNS/NTP gates and certificate-specific negative verdict requirements.
- Added safe 4096-byte SD scratch readback/CRC32 test with collision avoidance and Serial remove/remount event logs.
- Added bounded serial `diag` console, on-screen Shell commands, Windows pyserial live test collector and host regression.
- **No hardware test results claimed:** real board, internet and card hotplug need user-side runs.

## v2.0.0 — SD recovery and verified HTTPS

- Replaced insecure Browser and Shell HTTPS clients with verified mbedTLS CA
  chains, seven audited embedded Mozilla root certificates and an NTP time gate.
- Blocked HTTPS downgrade and plaintext downloads; `.qeapp`/theme downloads
  now require `Content-Length`, bounded stream and staging readback. Old
  insecure browser cache entries are not reused.
- Added bounded microSD health polling, rate-limited no-card boot retry and
  detection notifications. Never deinitialize/remount while WAV playback or
  pause holds a File. Re-mounted cards restore standard folders and app list.
- Atomic file updates re-read `.tmp` before replacing the previous `.bak`
  protected version. Shell exposes `sd` mount/error diagnostics.
- Added executable host regression for card removal/insertion, staged write
  corruption, CA fingerprint verification and untrusted certificate rejection.
- 21/21 C++ production units link with mock host APIs, NOT target PlatformIO.

## v1.9.0 — OS stability, cache crash recovery, networking hardening

- Fixed Qeafbrowser indefinitely waiting for the first page body byte after
  an HTTP 200: 8s inactivity and 25s stream budget, missing-body/error status
  checks, 32KB declared-length validation and truncated response rejection.
- Collect Content-Type headers on the ESP32 HTTPClient path, and do not mask
  actual HTTP 4xx/5xx replies with cached pages. Removed a duplicate malloc.
- Reject silently truncated/unsafe URLs; correct domain-only query URLs,
  query-only links, and relative dot-segments. Reject unsupported URI schemes.
- Stop download completion overwriting an existing theme or app package.
- SD atomic replacements now use .tmp + .bak and read-time recovery/rollback.
  The cache pruner counts streamed entries instead of first N listing results;
  Shell cache clear is streaming up to an explicit 128-file safety cap and
  displays errors when it cannot finish.
- WiFi NVS filters invalid/duplicate profiles at boot, repairs corrupt counts
  once, and avoids five-profile rewrites when a connection is unchanged.
- Nokia-inspired heavy glyph overlay draws subsequent passes transparently;
  formerly the solid background could erase first-pass strokes.
- Unsynced clock shows --:-- / Date not set instead of invented uptime HH:MM;
  display updates with a notification after NTP really synchronizes.
- Native C++ tests for URL, HTTP timeout/status/truncation, POSIX SD recovery,
  large cache cleanup and WiFi NVS wear/corruption; full host syntax/link gate.
  **No claim of target PlatformIO success or actual LCD/audio/RF validation.**

## v1.8.0 — Utilities / Multimedia / BLE refinement
- Added CalculatorEngine (bounded numerical input, safe math and on-screen 4x4 keypad).
- Added wrap-aware StopwatchEngine, 4 laps, 100ms dirty time redraw, task resume.
- Music: Now Playing, progress, volume, bounded no-repeat shuffle/repeat and background playlist advance.
- Music: finish delay for I2S DMA, natural-end event; no new screen framebuffer.
- Gallery: timed 4-second slideshow and external File Manager path support.
- BLE: strongest 16 scan results, properly closable detail view.
- New portable native tests plus full GNU++11 host link; PlatformIO/device validation pending.

## v1.7.0 – Signal-aware Saved WiFi Auto Connect

- Added nonblocking boot auto-scan and strongest-saved-AP selection across the complete scan list, with last-used SSID as a tie-break only.
- Tries lower-RSSI saved APs on rejection/timeout; no unverified passwords are persisted.
- Re-scans after a 5-second link-loss debounce; exponential retry wait is capped at 120 seconds (30/60/120s).
- Honors Settings Auto WiFi, Safe Mode and intentional Disconnect/radio-off; browsing the WiFi list alone is reversible.
- Added S60 240x320 standby WiFi status text: scanning/joining/SSID+RSSI/retry countdown. Dirty-region repaint for WiFi line and right icons preserves anti-flicker behavior; foreground titlebars also refresh the WiFi badge without repainting the title or clock.
- Direct Shell WiFi radio commands pause automatic selection, preventing competing scans/joins; simply browsing the WiFi list resumes after leaving it.
- Added `tools/wifi_host/test_auto_wifi.cpp`, `tools/test_v17_auto_wifi.py` and `docs/WIFI_V17_AUTOCONNECT.md`.
- Existing v1.6 keypad connection wizard, Themes, Browser, Shell and signed QEAPP installer retained.

- Package rejected UI with actionable error, signature-verified package details, two signed sample packages.
- Local key provisioning and package-signing CLI. No private key in release.
- GNU++11 host OpenSSL integration and negative tamper/legacy/foreign-signer tests.
- Toolchain mock checks are not an ESP32 target build or on-board hardware validation.

## v1.4.0 — QEAPP App Installer

- New versioned QEAPP/1 binary package with strict bounded manifest,
  optional 32×32 RGB565 icon, and optional bundled text.
- Streaming SHA-256 verification before install and during SD copying;
  staging-directory commit, collision-safe IDs, no implicit overwrite.
- App Installer Inbox/Installed UI with verified details, preview,
  confirmation, removable entries and fixed 12-app catalog.
- File Manager and Qeafbrowser download handoff; Applications launcher
  integrates installed web/text apps and uses existing opening animation.
- `docs/QEAPP_V14.md`, sample packages, deterministic builder and
  host tests. **No native execution; SHA256 not a signature.**

Earlier versions: v1.3 SD Platform, v1.2 Themes, v1.1 AMOLED Red, v1.0 S60 Green.

- Added Gallery with streamed BMP rendering plus PSRAM-backed TJpg_Decoder/PNGdec paths.
- Added bounded, paged Text Viewer and File Manager routing for image/text file types.
- Added Library category navigation for Images / Music / Documents.
- Integrated a Qeafbrowser-derived in-OS browser core with HTTP/HTTPS, explicit 6-hop redirects, fixed line/link pools, 32 KB PSRAM response buffer, keypad URL entry, link focus and back history.
- Preserved case-sensitive `href` values while parsing HTML and added `<img alt>` text fallback.
- Added S60 "Dang mo ung dung" / "Dang tiep tuc" application-opening screen with task-switcher resume semantics.

- Added Recent Apps to the Applications list.
- Expanded System Info with boot count, uptime, minimum heap, saved network count and alert count.
- Kept v0.5.1 linker isolation (`appCtx` and file-local runtime globals).

## v2.3.3 offline build tooling update
- Added `tools/build_offline.py`, CMD/PowerShell/POSIX launchers with preinstalled PlatformIO cache checks, rejecting HTTP(S) proxy guard, clean target build, SHA-256 and Vietnamese JSON/Markdown diagnostics.
- Added `tools/test_offline_build.py`: 10 deterministic tests with fake PlatformIO/cache (not target compilation).
- No changes to firmware C++/headers, board manifest, GPIO, signed QEAPP/2, or `.vqeaf` rendering.
- Actual target compilation still requires a populated PlatformIO installation and ESP32-S3 toolchain on the machine running the offline builder.

## v2.3.6 — ESP32-S3 icon self-test and target firmware size instrumentation
- Added dedicated ESP32-S3 diagnostic image with 192 frozen v2.3.4 RGB565
  golden CRC cases, real TFT draw timing and RAM diagnostics.
- Production TFT renderer now shares its bounded decoding function with
  on-chip synthetic framebuffer test; immutable RGB565 parity verified on host.
